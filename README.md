## About the Author

My name is Evans Kiplagat AKA Kongkip an AI engineer with a unique blend of expertise in Actuarial Science and a deep passion for applying AI in the medical field. My journey in this dynamic area began with my work at a medical AI startup, where we initially focused on diagnosing lung diseases through sound analysis. This venture later evolved into the realm of Ultrasound imaging, marking a significant pivot in our approach and objectives.

During my tenure at the startup, I played a pivotal role in developing and refining AI models that were instrumental in the diagnosis process. My contributions were not just limited to enhancing the accuracy of diagnoses, but also extended to automating aspects of image capture, thereby streamlining the entire diagnostic procedure. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also gave me invaluable insights into the practical challenges and potentials of AI in healthcare.

Through this repository, I aim to share my learnings, reflections, and analyses of various research papers in the field of medical AI. My goal is to contribute to the broader discourse in this field and to keep exploring innovative ways in which AI can transform healthcare.
