# Predicting Patient Outcomes with Graph Representation Learning

This paper by Emma Rocheteau, Catherine Tong, Petar Velickovic, Nicholas Lane, and Pietro Li√≤, focuses on the prediction of patient outcomes in Intensive Care Units (ICU) using a novel approach that combines Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Key Points of the Paper
### 1. Background and Motivation
- ICU patient outcome has traditionally focused on physiological time series data, often overlooking sparsed data like diagnoses and medications.
- Current models struggle with rare disease patterns due to their data processing methods.

### 2. Proposed Solution - LSTM-GNN.
- The authors proposed an LSTM-GNN hybrid model
