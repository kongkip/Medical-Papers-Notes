# Predicting Patient Outcomes with Graph Representation Learning

This paper by Emma Rocheteau, Catherine Tong, Petar Velickovic, Nicholas Lane, and Pietro Li√≤, focuses on the prediction of patient outcomes in Intensive Care Units (ICU) using a novel approach that combines Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Key Points of the Paper:
### 1. Background and Motivation
- ICU patient outcome has traditionally focused on physiological time series data, often overlooking sparse data like diagnoses and medications.
- Current models struggle with rare disease patterns due to their data processing methods.
- The authors took an inspiration from clinicians who tend to rely on their past experience of treating similar patients when making clinical judgements.
- They capture this similarity concept by constructing a patient graph where the nodes are patients and edges express relatedness in diagnoses.  

### 2. Proposed Solution - LSTM-GNN:
- The authors proposed an LSTM-GNN hybrid model. LSTMs extract temporal features, while GNNs handle patient neighbourhood information based on diagnoses.
- This approach aims to laverage diagnoses as relational information, connecting similar patients in a graph, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy.

### 3. Methodology:
- The model constructs a patient graph with nodes representing patients and edges expressing relatedness in diagnoses.
- The LSTM-GNN operates on this graph, encoding both temporal and graph-based features, which are then used for predicitons.

### 4. Data and Performance:
- The model was trained and evaluated using the eICU database, focusing on in-hospital mortality and length of ICU stay.
- Results indicated that LSTM-GNN outperforms LSTM-only models,especially in predicting the length of stay. This suggests that information from neighbouring patient cases enhances predictive performance.

### 5. Discussion and implications:
- The approach is particularly effective for the length of stay predicitons, higlighthing the benefit of considering diagnoses and patient similarities.
- This method can be extended to other sparse medical data, like shared medications, offering a broader application scope.

### Future Work:
- The paper suggests potential extensions like incorporating shared medications and procedures into the similarity scores.
- It also discusses the need for futher investigation into the sensitivity of the model to various parameters.
